# Heart_disease_ML_Project_Classifications

This project aims to compare different classification models for heart disease prediction using feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.
The dataset used is the Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 74 features and a label indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. 
The models include logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and more. The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
The goal is to find the best model that can accurately and efficiently diagnose heart disease based on the available data.
